## Section 2:

## Section 3:

Module Content:

1. List and Website Structure with semantic elements
2. Containers, Cascading, Inheritance and Specifity
3. The Box Model

- Inheritance : selected container rules apply to descendanats

- Cascading Style Sheets: Multiple rules can be applied to the same element.

- Specificity: More specific selecter's rule wins over less specific selector.

- The Box Model: Content - Padding - Border - Margin

  1. Content is usually the text inside our html element
  2. Padding is the space between the content and the border. There is padding for the top, right, bottom and left.
  3. Border outlines the content. You can specify border size, dashed/solid and it's color.
  4. Margin is the space between the content and other html element's content.

- Selectors & Combinators:

  1. Selectors:

  - Type -> elementname (h1, a)
  - ID -> #id (#todays_challenge)
  - Group (elementname, elementname)
  - Class (.class)

  2. Combinators:

  - Descendant (li p) (all p with li as ancestor)
  - Child (h2 > p) (Only p which are direct children of h2)
