    <h1>Upcoming Challenges</h1>
    <p id="challenges">
      One of my goals in the upcoming challenges is to learn more about CSS.
      Besides adding color and structure to simple paragraphs, I want to get
      better at styling a more complicated page that has multiple paragraphs,
      sections, etc and how I would structure them appropriately.
    </p>
    <p id="challenges">
      Another goal for these upcoming challenges is to continue learning about
      html and specifically how tags can help with accessibility issues that
      some visitors of a web page might have.
